|This is my first attempt of programming a minecraft plugin.  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------  |
|If two players get near each other, the poison effect will be|
|applied to both players. I'm aware that this would be easy to|
|do with commandblocks or probably datapacks, but I want to ..|
|get some experience with plugins.............................|
